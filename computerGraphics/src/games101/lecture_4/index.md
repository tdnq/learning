# transformation cout

## 3Dtransmations
### use homogeneous coordinates again:
* 3D point = (x,y,z,1)T;
* 3D vector =(x,y,z,0)T;
### compose any 3D rotation from Rx,Ry,Rz;

## Viewing transformation

### view/camera transformation
#### what is view transformation?
* Finda good "angle" to put the camera;
#### how to perform view transformation?
1. Define the camera first
    * Postion
    * Look-at /gaze direction
    * Up direction
2. Key observation
### projection transformation
#### orthographic projection
* paralel
#### perspective projection
* paralel lines not paralel;converge to sigle point.
* near maybe big,far maybe samll
